# Keras_Binary_Classification_ANN
Artificial Neural Network Model For Binary Classification

Disclaimer: This code snippet is developed with an intension for generic use only. I hereby declare that the code was not part of any of my professional development work. Also, no sensitive or confidential data sources are used for this development.

Description: The repository consists of ANN deep learning algorithm for regression problem. It is an end-to-end code and does not require any user intervention

Note:
1. This scripts perform k-fold cross validation with hyper parameter tuning
2. User Input Section allows set all model parameters as well as data source specification. Users dont need to edit anything except this section. This is a fully automated end to end code
3. The script perform all data preprocessing however it is assumed that data is cleaned i.e. no outlier or missing value is present.
4. Target variable should be categorical in nature with string not as numeric values
5. Random Sampling is performed based user given test split and only test sample model evaluation metrices are reported

Compatibility: The code is developed and tested on Jupyter and Spyder Notebook using Python 3.7
